## Phase 1: Research and plan the SmartDoc architecture
- [x] Research how to integrate Gemini API for document Q&A.
- [x] Choose a specific vector database (ChromaDB seems promising).
- [x] Outline the overall system architecture (frontend, backend, database).

## Phase 2: Set up the backend Flask application with Gemini API integration
- [x] Create a Flask project.
- [x] Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies (Flask, google-generativeai, chromadb).
- [x] Implement an endpoint for document upload.
- [x] Integrate Gemini API for text extraction and embedding generation.

## Phase 3: Implement document processing and vector storage system
- [x] Process uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.) to extract text.
- [x] Generate embeddings for document chunks using Gemini API.
- [x] Store document chunks and their embeddings in ChromaDB.
- [x] Implement an endpoint for answering questions using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

## Phase 4: Create the React frontend with beautiful UI design
- [x] Create a new React project.
- [x] Design the UI for document upload and Q&A interface.
- [x] Implement frontend logic for uploading documents.
- [x] Implement frontend logic for sending questions and displaying answers.

## Phase 5: Integrate frontend with backend and test the complete system
- [x] Connect React frontend to Flask backend.
- [x] Test document upload functionality.
- [x] Test Q&A functionality.
- [x] Implement error handling and user feedback.

## Phase 6: Deploy the SmartDoc application and deliver to user
- [ ] Prepare the application for deployment.
- [ ] Deploy the Flask backend.
- [ ] Deploy the React frontend.
- [ ] Provide instructions to the user on how to access and use the application.
