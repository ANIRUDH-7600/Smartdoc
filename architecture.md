# SmartDoc System Architecture

## 1. Overview
SmartDoc is a web application that allows users to upload various document types (PDF, DOCX, etc.) and ask questions related to their content. The system will leverage Google's Gemini API for natural language understanding and response generation, and a vector database (ChromaDB) for efficient document storage and retrieval.

## 2. Components

### a. Frontend (React.js)
- User Interface: A clean and intuitive UI for document uploads, question input, and answer display.
- Document Upload: Allows users to select and upload documents.
- Question Input: A text area for users to type their questions.
- Answer Display: Displays the AI-generated answers.
- API Interaction: Communicates with the backend API to send documents and questions, and receive answers.

### b. Backend (Flask)
- API Endpoints: Provides RESTful APIs for document upload, question submission, and potentially document management.
- Document Processing: Receives uploaded documents, extracts text, and converts them into a suitable format for embedding.
- Gemini API Integration: Interacts with the Gemini API to:
    - Generate embeddings for document chunks.
    - Generate responses to user questions based on retrieved document content.
- Vector Database Interaction: Stores and retrieves document embeddings from ChromaDB.
- Business Logic: Handles the overall flow of the application, including document chunking, embedding generation, similarity search, and response generation.

### c. Vector Database (ChromaDB)
- Document Storage: Stores vector embeddings of document chunks.
- Similarity Search: Enables efficient retrieval of relevant document chunks based on the similarity of their embeddings to the question's embedding.

### d. Gemini API
- Embedding Generation: Converts text (document chunks, user questions) into numerical vector representations.
- Generative AI: Generates human-like text responses to user questions, potentially using retrieved document content as context.

## 3. Data Flow

1. **Document Upload:**
    - User uploads a document via the React frontend.
    - Frontend sends the document to the Flask backend via an API endpoint.

2. **Document Processing & Embedding:**
    - Backend receives the document.
    - Text is extracted from the document.
    - The extracted text is chunked into smaller, manageable pieces.
    - Each chunk is sent to the Gemini API to generate a vector embedding.
    - The document chunks and their corresponding embeddings are stored in ChromaDB.

3. **Question Submission & Answer Generation:**
    - User enters a question in the React frontend.
    - Frontend sends the question to the Flask backend via an API endpoint.
    - Backend receives the question.
    - The question is sent to the Gemini API to generate a vector embedding.
    - The question's embedding is used to perform a similarity search in ChromaDB to retrieve the most relevant document chunks.
    - The retrieved document chunks (context) and the user's question are sent to the Gemini API.
    - Gemini API generates an answer based on the provided context and question.
    - The generated answer is sent back to the Flask backend.
    - Backend sends the answer to the React frontend.
    - Frontend displays the answer to the user.

## 4. Technologies
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Database: ChromaDB (Vector Database)
- AI/ML: Google Gemini API

## 5. Future Considerations
- User authentication and authorization.
- Support for more document types.
- Enhanced error handling and logging.
- Scalability and deployment considerations (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
